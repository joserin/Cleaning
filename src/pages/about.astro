        <p>To write the best "About Us" text for your cleaning service website, I need some more information about you and your business. Can you tell me:

            Your name or business name:
            What kind of cleaning services do you offer? (e.g., residential, commercial, deep cleaning, etc.)
            What makes you unique? (e.g., eco-friendly products, flexible scheduling, competitive prices, etc.)
            What's your passion for cleaning? (e.g., helping people reclaim their time, creating sparkling spaces, etc.)
        </p>
